# Step 1.1: Create ReportingStructure Class

## Iteration 1
## Implementation Details
- Created ReportingStructure class in data package
- Added two fields: employee and numberOfReports
- Implemented basic constructor and getters
- Used direct Employee reference instead of just ID for easier access



# Step 1.2: Implement REST Endpoint and Service Layer

## Iteration 1
## Implementation Details
 - Created ReportingStructureController with GET endpoint
 - Implemented ReportingStructureService interface
 - Added ServiceImpl with recursive counting logic
 - Used Set to prevent infinite loops in circular references
 - Endpoint attempts to follow existing API patterns
 - Service layer designed to separate business logic from controller
 - Using the recursive implementation handles nested reporting structures
 - Likewise, added safety against circular references



# Step 1.3: Implement Unit Tests

## Iteration 1
## Implementation Details
- Created test class for ReportingStructure endpoint
- Tests cover three scenarios:
  1. Full hierarchy (John Lennon - 4 reports)
  2. Partial hierarchy (Ringo - 2 reports)
  3. No reports (Pete Best)
- Used Spring Boot test framework for integration testing
- Uses the existing test data from employee_database.json
- Tested both employee data and report counts



# Step 2.1: Create Compensation Class

## Iteration 1
## Implementation Details
- Created Compensation class with the required fields
- Added employeeId for MongoDB indexing
- Used LocalDate for date handling
- Included getters/setters for all fields
- Integer salary type assuming whole currency units
